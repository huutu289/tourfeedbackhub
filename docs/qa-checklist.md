# Content QA Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing or approving new marketing content.

- **Hero imagery**
  - Confirm hero images are at least 1600px wide (desktop) and 1200px wide (mobile crops).
  - Optimise format (JPEG/WebP) and ensure file size stays under 1.5MB without noticeable quality loss.
- **Accessibility**
  - Provide descriptive `alt` text for every hero, story cover, and tour image.
  - Verify semantic headings (single `h1` per page) and confirm call-to-action buttons have aria labels when the label is not visible.
- **Metadata**
  - Set a unique page title (`<title>`) and meta description for: Home, About, Tour Types, Tours, Stories, Contact, Feedback, and Admin views.
  - Double-check Open Graph image/description values for social sharing when applicable.
- **Copy validation**
  - Proofread English copy for About, Tour Types, Tours, and Stories pages; confirm key sections exist in English even when additional locales are added.
  - Ensure CTAs and form labels remain consistent across locales.
- **Content freshness**
  - Check story publish dates and review highlights are up to date within the last quarter.
  - Validate tour pricing and duration data against the internal rate sheet before publishing.
